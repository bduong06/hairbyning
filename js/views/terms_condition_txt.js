<h2>Acceptance of terms</h2>
<p>Statement: "By accessing, browsing, or using this booking website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy".</p>
<h2>Booking and appointment policy</h2>
<p>Booking confirmation: The client will receive an email or SMS to confirm the appointment details.
<p>Booking Time: Specify that clients should arrive on time, for example, 5 to 10 minutes early.</p>
<p>Late arrivals: Explain the consequences of being late. After a set grace period (e.g., 15 minutes), the salon may decline the service or shorten the appointment time, and the client may still be charged a late fee or a portion of the service cost.</p>
<h2>Payment terms</h2>
<p>Required deposits: Some salons require a deposit, especially for new clients, group bookings, or long and expensive services. This deposit is often non-refundable if the client violates the cancellation policy.
Credit card on file: Require a credit card to secure appointments. This allows the salon to enforce cancellation or no-show fees.</p>
<p>Payment methods: List the accepted payment methods, such as credit/debit card, online payment, or cash.</p>
<p>Full payment: Confirm that the remaining balance is due at the time of service completion.</p>
<h2>Cancellation and no-show policy</h2>
<p>Notice period: Specify the minimum notice required to cancel or reschedule an appointment without penalty (e.g., 24, 48, or 72 hours).</p>
<p>Late cancellation fee: Explain the charge for cancellations made after the notice period has passed (e.g., 50% of the service cost).</p>
<p>No-show fee: State that clients who miss an appointment without notice will be charged the full service amount.</p>
<h2>Product and service refund policy</h2>
<p>Service refunds: Detail the process for clients who are unhappy with their service. Many salons offer to fix the issue within a short timeframe (e.g., 48 hours) but do not provide refunds.</p>
<h2>User account and data privacy</h2>
<p>Personal data: Explain what information is collected (name, contact details, booking history), why it is collected, and how it is used. This is a critical component for compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR.
Opt-in for marketing: State that consent is required before sending promotional materials to clients.</p>
